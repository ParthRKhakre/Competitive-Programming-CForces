Bit Manipulation
bitwise operation are :
very fast compare to addition and substraction
very very Insanely fast compare to multiplication and division

In 1s - 10^8 operation
   1s - 10^9 operation


#1. Check a Number is Even or Odd

Normal Approach is : 
if(x%2 == 0) Even
else Odd

Bitwise Approach: Check the LSB of number in Binary and use bit-wise AND
x = 9 ---> 1001 (odd)
x = 10 --> 1010 (Even)

x & 1 == 1 then odd
x & 1 == 0 then even 

e.g. 9 & 1 == 1  -- odd 

It takes O(1) time.

#2.Check number is pow of 2
there will be single bit 1 if x is a power of two

e.g
x = 0001000000

if you do x - 1 then number becomes 
x - 1 = 0000111111

take and of x,x-1
  x & (x-1) == 0 then its pow of 2
  else its not power of 2

  TC : O(1)
Note : This Approach doesnot work for x == 0  

#3.Playing with Kth Bit
(1<<k) = 2^k
